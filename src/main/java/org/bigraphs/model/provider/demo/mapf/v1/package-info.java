/**
 * This demo package shows the bigraph model provider in action.
 * It supports (N x M) bigrids with k agents.
 * Only the {@link org.bigraphs.model.provider.base.BLocationModelData} must be provided.
 * <p>
 * The world model provider implements a set of providers that finally are merged to one model provider.
 * A complete view is maintained of the model, but
 * the parts/layers are also kept separated for easy access and modification.
